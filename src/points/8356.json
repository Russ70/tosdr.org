We will fight it because nothing we have is relevant to anything but your login. We don't track what you search or when you search.\r\nThe ONLY event that would cause us to pass user data to another entity is if 420A3 is acquired by or merged with another company or involved in any other business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets, we may transfer or assign your information as part of or in connection with the transaction. Finally, in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, information may be transferred as a business asset.\r\n"
