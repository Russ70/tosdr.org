All articles on the service are to the purpose of dissecting and analyzing pre-existing written works, and are subject to alterations by other users as these works are publicly released. Because of this, articles and pages that are written about a given work are within Fair Use, and cannot be taken down. Likewise, contributors to the service hold no copyright on the articles that they create or edit, as they are contributions made to the sight with information on a pre-existing work that is not their own, though they may receive credit for their actions. No \"original\" content is created on the service, for the service exists solely to break down the narrative properties of an original work rather than be its platform."
