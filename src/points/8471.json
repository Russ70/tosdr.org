All the information about your account and your actions on the site is easily available to the government at a single request. People have been fined and even given real prison sentences because of a post/post share/like. For example, this woman almost got 6 years of prison for merely saving someone else's photo and adding a comment to it - https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/07/25/russian-woman-reportedly-faces-6-years-in-prison-for-insulting-memes-a62341."
