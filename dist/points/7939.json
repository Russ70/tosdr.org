Based on the information from the page on this matter, this only really applies to the pictures or media clips that are used as examples on their pages, as their written analyses are within Fair Use.\r\n\r\nThey will only use copyrighted images and videos so long as they are either used with explicit permission from the creator or copyright holder, or are within the bounds of Fair Use, with the content being \"excerpts\" from a full work, with copyright credit being given to the proper owner. Administrators will reject images or videos that are outside of these terms, and should a copyright holder request the removal of their content from a TV Tropes page, it will be done."
