They also consider personal data combined with non-personal data to be personal data.  The privacy policy states that you can ask for them to correct, amend, or delete your personal data \"where it is inaccurate\". You can easily download, amend, or delete your personal data on https://www.tunnelbear.com/account/privacy.  A download of data can be emailed to you. You can update payment details and your email address yourself, but for all other data, you need to send an email to privacy@tunnelbear.com. Deleting all data involves deleting your account."
